Git is a version control system that helps track changes in files.
Git keeps a history of all changes made to a project, allowing you to revert to previous versions or compare different states.

Key Git Terminology:
Repository (Repo): A project folder where all files and the version history are stored.
Commit: A snapshot of the changes you've made to the repository at a particular point in time.
Branch: A separate line of development that allows you to work on new features without affecting the main project.
Merge: Combining changes from different branches.
Clone: Making a copy of a repository from GitHub to your local machine.
Push: Uploading your changes from your local machine to the remote repository (e.g., on GitHub).
Pull: Downloading the latest changes from the remote repository to your local machine.

Best Practices
Commit Often: Commit your changes frequently, with clear and descriptive messages.
Branching: Use branches for new features or bug fixes, and merge them into the main branch once completed.
Sync Regularly: Regularly pull changes from the remote repository to keep your local copy up to date.

GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing Git repositories, providing additional features for collaboration, like pull requests and issues.
